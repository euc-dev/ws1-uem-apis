Each Workspace ONE UEM tenant provides an API/help page that displays all the API commands, parameters and usage, as well as a mechanism to test each call.

This process of testing APIs on the API/help page was cumbersome, especially when having to then manually build the same API call in Postman. It was time-consuming and prone to errors.

Omnissa has recently introduced a comprehensive Postman collection for Workspace ONE UEM. This collection includes all available API calls, pre-configured and ready to use, significantly improving workflow efficiency.

## Getting Started
Utilising a Postman collection is easy and an exceptionally fast way to get started. If you are new to working with APIs or Postman, see the [Workspace ONE UEM APIs](https://www.postman.com/vmw-euc/workspace/workspace-one-uem-apis/overview) overview in the [:simple-postman:](https://www.postman.com/) documentation to help you get started.

The highlevel process documented in the **Workspace ONE UEM APIs** overview link above are:
1. Create Fork from Existing Collection
2. Collect your tenant values
3. Create an *environment* and add your tenant values as variables, including authentication
4. Use the APIs!
