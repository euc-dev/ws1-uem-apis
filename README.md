# ws1-uem-apis

Workspace ONE UEM provides APIs to assist administrators with interacting with the platform. This docs repo provides information on how to get started with those APIs.

This repo is structured to feed into the developer.omnissa.com Developer Portal via the [](https://github.com/euc-dev/developer.omnissa.github.io) repo using MkDocs published by GitHub Pages. All documentation should be created in MarkDown format with the capabilities of MkDocs and the Material theme in mind under the /docs/apis/ws1-uem-apis folder. This folder will be integrated into the [developer portal repo](https://github.com/euc-dev/developer.omnissa.github.io) when built using a GitHub Action.
